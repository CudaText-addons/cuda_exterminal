Plugin for CudaText.

Advantages over Terminal+ plugin:

- ExTerminal tries to mimic real interactive terminal behaviour.
  That means that you can use apps like nano/vim/htop/python inside it.

To configure, call menu item in the "Options/ Settings-plugins / ExTerminal"
to edit config file. Options are boolean, values 0/1

Options:
- colors: display colors in terminal. Working slow as for now. Disabled by default
- esc_focuses_editor: focus editor by pressing ESC key instead of sending it to terminal.
    Disabled by default.
    Hint: Ctrl+[ key sends ESC code to the terminal, you can use it instead of ESC key.
